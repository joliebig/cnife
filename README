cnife is an extensible Java library for the (semi)automatic transformation
of #ifdef annotated source code in C++ programs into FeatureC++
feature-modules (see FeatureC++ project website for more information;
http://fosd.net/fcc). cnife recognizes a set of patterns automatically
(#ifdef usage in software systems) and tries to transform the annotated code
into feature-modules.
